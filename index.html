            <p class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Why privacy-preserving benchmarking?</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">Developers typically evaluate AI systems by first having them answer a number of exam questions on a given topic. Then, they check those answers by automatically comparing them with the reference solutions.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">However, there is a growing need to evaluate AI systems on sensitive topics, such as bioterrorism or cyberwarfare. In these cases, a benchmark meant to assess dangerous AI capabilities would <i>itself</i> pose a hazard. The benchmark's reference solutions would provide a veritable compendium on topics better left undiscussed.</p> 
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">In this context, we introduce <i>hashmarks</i>, a simple alternative to benchmarks that enable the assessment of dangerous AI capabilities without divulging the reference solutions.</p>

            <p class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">How does it work?</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">Building on ideas from cryptography and federated learning, a hashmark works by first "hashing" the reference solutions into sequences that are not human-readable. For instance, the text "reference solution" would get hashed to "dc65678e6ea9f..." even before leaving the device of the expert who contributed that particular exam question to the hashmark.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">When an AI system is later tested on a hashmark, its candidate answers get hashed in the same exact way. Finally, if the hashed versions of the candidate answer and the reference solution are identical, then the AI system is deemed to have answered that particular question correctly.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">This directly builds on <a  class="underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgpsIBLvrGY">best practices from secure password storage</a>, except that passwords are swapped with reference solutions, usernames are swapped with exam questions, and the records database as a whole is swapped with the exam.</p>

            <p class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">What kinds of exam question are appropriate?</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">While the hashmark as an evaluation mechanism provides valuable security benefits, it also has limitations. The primary constraint comes from the fact that even answers that differ by a handful of characters get hashed in completely different ways (e.g. "Reference Solution" gets mapped to "8c411e8ea95af..."). This means that questions included in a hashmark need to have a narrow, well-defined, unambiguous answer. For instance, a question could ask for the standard name of a certain substance, or the exact integer denoting a networking port.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">The second constraint comes from the fact that, while the hashing is virtually impossible to reverse, one could still uncover the human-readable solutions by brute-forcing a large number of candidate answers until obtaining a match. This means that questions included in a hashmark should preferably call for obscure, non-trivial answers. If, instead, a question called for a "yes" or "no" answer, then it could be trivially brute-forced by hashing both possible answers and identifying the matching hash (see <a  class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow table attacks</a>). <span class="font-bold">In sum, questions should call for answers that are obscure, yet unambiguous.</span></p>

            <p class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">How can I contribute questions?</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">If you read this, you have likely been approached to contribute to the assessment of sensitive AI capabilities on a particular topic. You can contribute your expertise by populating the spreadsheet you have been sent separately with novel questions and reference solutions. You can use your local spreadsheet editor of choice to accomplish this. Please err on the side of only including questions for which you are confident in the answer and which satisfy the above desiderata.</p>
            
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">In addition to contributing your own questions, your spreadsheet might also contain questions contributed by other experts. Solving these additional exam questions by filling in your answers would help us increase the quality of the hashmark by filtering out questions with low inter-annotator agreement. Note that we can achieve this by measuring consensus among the hashed answers, without having access to the human-readable answers ourselves. Please err on the side of not answering external questions when not confident in the answers.</p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">After filling in the spreadsheet, load it on the current page using the button below. After the file is uploaded, it automatically gets processed in your browser so as to hash the reference solutions. <span class="font-bold">Note that the hashing method is intentionally designed to be slow and resource-intensive</span> (i.e. ~1 minute per reference solution while fully utilizing one CPU core). The purpose of this mild annoyance during hashmark creation is to implicitly scale into a major obstacle for a brute-force attacker. Once processing has been completed, you can download the resulting file. The tool expects spreadsheets in CSV format, and issues processed spreadsheets in the same format.</p>

            <p class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl">Why trust this protocol?</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">This hashmark implementation employs Argon2id hashing, <a class="underline" href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/hash-functions">the official recommendation</a> of <a class="underline" href="https://owasp.org/">OWASP</a>, a leading organization promoting secure software. To confirm that we are in fact employing this algorithm, consider using a third-party Argon2id hashing tool to check whether the output matches that of the present tool.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">However, keep in mind that we run basic preprocessing before hashing: lowercasing, removing duplicate whitespace, and trimming trailing whitespace. For instance, "    Reference &nbsp&nbsp   Solution   " would be preprocessed to "reference solution" before hashing, in order to avoid superficial divergences. In addition, we employ the exam questions as <a class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">"salt"</a> for the reference solution, forcing brute-force attackers to start from scratch with each exam question. Finally, we employ 32 rehashings and a 100 MiB memory burden, making hashing orders of magnitude more resource-intensive than with the recommended settings, as a proportional response to the nature of the content being presently processed.</p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-600">Furthermore, the hashing tool accessible through this page is entirely "client-side." In other words, it runs entirely on your device, despite having been delivered through a web page. To confirm this, you can try using the tool after turning off your internet connection. Alternatively, you can verify the lack of network requests in your browser's developer console.</p>
